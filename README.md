# Why this?

I was kinda bored and thought a (possibly non-complete) port of BSML might be very useful for quest mods despite probably objections by some people.

also I was wondering how difficult it would be to make it work and turns out not too difficult

# Building it

Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RedBrumbler/Quest-BSML.git --recursive &&
cd Quest-BSML &&
qpm-rust restore &&
pwsh ./build.ps1
```
